# SkinDeep.ai - PLGL Technology

This repository contains the PLGL (Preference Learning in Generative Latent Spaces) technology developed by SkinDeep.ai Inc.

## Overview

PLGL is a revolutionary approach to personalized AI content generation that learns user preferences through simple ratings rather than complex prompts. Originally developed in 2018-2019, this technology enables any generative model with a latent space to create personalized content.

## Repository Structure

- `/plgl-website/` - The PLGL technology website and documentation
- `/plgl-core/` - Core PLGL Python package (pip installable)
- `/PLGL_Whitepaper.md` - Comprehensive technical whitepaper
- `/ProvisionalPatent.txt` - Original provisional patent filing from 2019
- `/LAUNCH_WEBSITE.md` - Instructions for deploying the website

## Key Features

- **No Prompting Required**: Users simply rate examples, and the AI learns their preferences
- **Universal Application**: Works with any generative model that has a latent space
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Can operate without sharing personal data
- **Open Source**: Released under MIT License for community benefit

## Applications

PLGL technology can be applied to:
- Music generation and personalized playlists
- Art and design creation
- Drug discovery and molecular design
- Architecture and building design
- Story and content generation
- Fashion design
- Game level generation
- Privacy-preserving dating apps
- Zero-prompt social media feeds
- Personalized news curation
- And many more...

## Original Implementation
