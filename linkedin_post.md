# LinkedIn Post: SkinDeep Open Source Announcement

Been sitting on something for a while now, and figured it's time to let it out into the wild.

I'm open-sourcing SkinDeep and PLGL (Preference Learning in Generative Latent Spaces) - technology I developed back in 2018-2019 that learns what you like without you having to describe it. Think Tinder for AI content generation - you just swipe, and it figures out your preferences.

The core insight was simple: why make people write prompts when they can just rate examples? PLGL navigates the latent spaces of generative models based on learned preferences. No typing. No technical knowledge. Just thumbs up or down.

Back in 2019, we demonstrated this with facial preference learning using StyleGAN. But the applications go way beyond that - music generation, drug discovery, architecture design, personalized content feeds, even privacy-preserving dating apps where you match based on preferences without sharing photos.

What makes PLGL interesting in today's AI landscape:
• Works with ANY generative model that has a latent space
• Learns preferences users can't articulate ("I'll know it when I see it")
• Scales efficiently with SVM classifiers and GPU batch processing
• Enhances existing prompt-based systems rather than replacing them

The patent's been filed, the code's documented, and examples are ready to run. But here's the thing - I've got my hands full with VDO.Ninja and SocialStream.Ninja, both of which are taking off in ways I never expected. Rather than let PLGL gather dust, I figure the community can do more with it than I can alone.

For startups looking for ideas: imagine TikTok-style discovery for AI content, personalized game levels that adapt to player preferences, or medical molecules designed to optimize for specific properties. The possibilities are genuinely endless.

Not abandoning the project - just acknowledging I can't give it the attention it deserves while juggling other successes. Sometimes the best thing you can do for an idea is set it free.

Code's at github.com/skindeepai. Original videos from 2019 are linked in the repo if you want to see where this all started.

Who knows - maybe one of you will build the next billion-dollar company on top of it. Stranger things have happened.
